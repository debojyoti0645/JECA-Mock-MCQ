      ],
      correctAnswerIndex: 0,
      explanation:

      correctAnswerIndex: 2,
      explanation:
        "In C, `true` is represented by `1` and `false` by `0` in boolean contexts. `x > 0` (5 > 0) is true (1), and `y < 15` (10 < 15) is true (1). `1 && 1` evaluates to `1`.",

      explanation:
        "The post-increment operator (`a++`) uses the current value of `a` (which is 5) in the expression first, and then increments `a` to 6. So, `5` is printed.",

      correctAnswerIndex: 1,
      explanation:

      correctAnswerIndex: 2,
      explanation:
        "In basic linked allocation, each disk block contains a pointer to the next block of the file. FAT centralizes these pointers in a table, thus saving disk space within data blocks that would otherwise be used for pointers, but more importantly, it improves direct access by allowing the OS to traverse the chain of pointers in memory rather than on disk for each access.",

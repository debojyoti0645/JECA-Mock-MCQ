      ],
      correctAnswerIndex: 0,
      explanation:

      correctAnswerIndex: 2,
      explanation:
        "In C, `true` is represented by `1` and `false` by `0` in boolean contexts. `x > 0` (5 > 0) is true (1), and `y < 15` (10 < 15) is true (1). `1 && 1` evaluates to `1`.",

      explanation:
        "The post-increment operator (`a++`) uses the current value of `a` (which is 5) in the expression first, and then increments `a` to 6. So, `5` is printed.",

      correctAnswerIndex: 1,
      explanation:
